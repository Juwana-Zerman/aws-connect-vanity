# aws-connect-vanity

The purpose of this project is to create a Lambda that converts a caller's phone number to vanity numbers when they call into an Amazon Connect Contact Center. The best 5 resulting vanity numbers along with the caller's number will be saved in a DynamoDB table.
An Amazon Connect contact flow will be created that looks at the caller's phone number and says 3 vanity possibilities that come back from the Lambda function.

1. Include explanation for why I chose to implement the solution the way I did and any struggles and problems I had to overcome while implementing the solution.
2. Did I take any shortcuts that would be a bad practice in productions?
3. With more time, what other features would I have included? Anything to add for the "real world"?
